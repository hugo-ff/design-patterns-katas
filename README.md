## 👋 Introduction

Design patterns are like the superheroes of software development, swooping in to save the day when we face recurring design challenges. In this playground, we turn learning into a game with small coding exercises known as katas. Get ready to level up your design pattern skills!

## 🎨 Design Patterns

Explore the universe of design patterns, organized by their superpowers:

### Creational Patterns

1. 🦸‍♂️ Singleton
2. 🏗️ Builder
3. 🏭 Factory Method

### Structural Patterns

1. 🔍 Observer
2. 🌲 Composite
3. 🌉 Bridge
4. 🔄 Adapter
5. 🎭 Decorator

### Behavioral Patterns

1. 🔄 State
2. 🎭 Strategy

Each design pattern has its own secret lair (directory) containing a README file with the pattern's backstory, use cases, and an example implementation as a kata.

## 👩‍💻 Getting Started

Embark on your coding quest:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-katas.git
   ```

2. Choose a design pattern adventure:

   ```bash
   cd design-patterns-katas/singleton
   ```

3. Read the README file for the design pattern to unravel its mysteries.

4. Delve into the code, uncover the solution, and run any provided examples.
