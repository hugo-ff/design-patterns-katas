## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring design problems in software development. Katas, in this context, are small coding exercises that help reinforce design patterns understanding and implementation.

This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to design patterns katas. It's a resource for learning and reference for those interested in mastering the art of applying design patterns in their software projects.

## Design Patterns

The following design patterns are covered in this repository:

1. Singleton
2. Builder
3. Observer
4. Composite
5. Bridge
6. State
7. Factory Method
8. Adapter
9. Strategy

Each design pattern has its own directory containing a README file explaining the pattern, its use cases, and an example implementation as a kata.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions or run the katas locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns-katas.git

2. Navigate to the specific design pattern directory:

   ```bash
   cd design-patterns-katas/singleton

3. Read the README file for the design pattern to understand its concept and implementation details.

4. Explore the code, review the solution, and run any provided examples.
